A maze game using only python turtle. Pygame for music!!!

## TODO
First you need to download Pygame by openning your cmd and type in:
###python3.6 -m pip install pygame

or 

you can <a href="www.pygame.org">click here</a> to go to pygame.org

Third run the python file.
It should be like this:

## Updates 
 I am a kid so I dont have that much time to update the game.
 
 I'll try to update monthly or weekly.
 
 For this 0.01 version I created a maze and a character that you can control with The four direction keys.In later version I'll create enemy and more traps. I got this from a Youtube video. Click here to See how that person make the game!!!
